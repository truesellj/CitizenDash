Website to help others keep track of critical information all in one place.

Once Signed-In the user can create 1 of 3 modules. 

ToDo: Create a card for a particular subject listing benchmarks the user can check off for accomplishing that task

Price Tracker: User can enter prices for the places that they shop to track them and determine the least expensive place to buy their groceries ultimately saving more money.

Triple-Search: Instead of picking from a certain search, try all three at the same time. Entering one search query yields 3 search engine results: DuckDuckGo, Bing, and Google.

The user should be able to do all this from one single landing page, but there are other options like editing from a wider dashboard.

There is also an admin page where the Admin user's will be able to add and delete users.
